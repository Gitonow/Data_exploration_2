***Conditions for using the data****
	
The data published here is provided free of charge for the scientific research community.  The data was obtained in the Theunissen lab at UC Berkeley and this fact should be acknowledged in all publications (including abstracts, posters and talks) that analyze the data.  Prior consent from the authors is not required but is highly recommended since additional methods, data and software could be made available for the benefit of the research effort.  
Parts of this data set have been used in prior published work from the Theunissen lab.  It should also be noted that prior publications from the lab almost certainly contain a larger data set.  This fact should be taken into account when making comparisons or attempting to replicate results.
