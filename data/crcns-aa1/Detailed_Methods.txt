***   Electrophysiological recordings.   ***

All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at University of California, Berkeley. All birds were raised by their parents in our zebra finch colony.  The colony consisted of social groups of zebra finches housed in large cages furnished with finch toys, perches and unrestricted access to food, water and grit.  Baths and food treats were given on a weekly basis.  The birds had access to 24-hour veterinary care.

Extracellular single-unit recordings were obtained from adult, urethane-anesthetized male zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata).  Neural recordings were conducted in a double-walled anechoic sound-attenuated chamber (Industrial Acoustics, Bronx, NY). The bird was positioned ~20 cm in front of a Bose 101 speaker so that the bird's beak was centered both horizontally and vertically with the center of the speaker cone. The output of the speaker was measured before each experiment with a Radio Shack electret condenser microphone to ensure a flat response (±5 dB) from 250 to 8000 Hz.

Extracellular recordings were obtained with epoxy-coated tungsten electrodes (0.5-7.0 MOhm; Frederick Haer, Bowdoinham, ME, and A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA). The electrodes were advanced into the brain with a stepping microdrive. We typically recorded from two brain areas simultaneously. The extracellular signal was obtained with a Neuroprobe amplifier (A-M Systems model 1800; 100x gain; high-pass fc 300 Hz; low-pass fc 5 kHz), displayed on a multichannel oscilloscope (TDS 210, Tektronix, Wilsonville, OR), and monitored on an audio amplifier/loud-speaker (AM8, Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA).  A second recording rig used the System 3 technology from Tucker-Davis.   Single-unit spike arrival times were obtained either by thresholding or by spike sorting software.

Pure tones (250-8000 Hz), zebra finch songs, synthetic songs (syn-songs), modulation-limited noise (ml-noise, described below), and white noise were used as search stimuli. If the response to any of these stimuli was significantly different from the baseline firing rate, determined by an on-line t test, or the response was clearly time locked to some portion of the stimulus, then we acquired 10 trials of data to each of 20 zebra finch songs, and 10 ml-noise stimuli.  Ml-noise was designed to have flat power spectrum between 250 and 8000 Hz, and the absolute power level was adjusted so that the peak value in the power spectrum of song (found around 3.5 kHz) matched the steady power level of the ml-noise. Ml-noise therefore had more total power than song. Finally, the absolute levels of both stimuli were adjusted so that average peak levels in song stimuli were at 75 dB sound pressure level (SPL) measured with a B&K sound level meter (rms weighting B, fast) positioned 25 cm in front of the speaker at the location of the bird's head. With the same absolute level adjustment, the average peak ml-noise level was 81 dB SPL. Presentation of the stimuli was random within a trial. Two seconds of background spontaneous activity was recorded before the presentation of each stimulus. A random interstimulus interval with a uniform distribution between 4 and 6 sec was used.

At the end of a recording pass, one to three electrolytic lesions (100 µA for 5 sec) were made to verify the recording sites of that pass. Lesions were made well outside of any auditory areas, unless it was the last recording pass.



***   Stimuli   ***

The conspecific stimuli used were of normal, colony-reared adult male zebra finches singing undirected song.  Experimental subjects had no exposure to these songs (either via playback or via direct interactions with the singer) prior to the recording session.

The ml-noise stimuli used were random ripple sounds generated by the following procedure.  These sounds are also referred to as ripple-noise in the auditory literature.  We first obtained the spectral-temporal log envelope function of the desired sound (i.e., its spectrogram in logarithmic units) by a sum of ripple component sounds. Ripple sounds are broad band sounds with a spectrogram that is the auditory equivalent of a sinusoidal grating.  We summed up 100 ripple sounds with constant power and a distribution bounded by 50 Hz and 2 cycles/kHz, the extrema of most modulations found in zebra finch song.  Finally, we obtained the sound pressure waveform by first taking the exponential of the normalized log amplitude envelope, SNorm(t,f), and then using a spectrographic inversion routine.

Ml-noise is called "flatrip" in the directory structure.
